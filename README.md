# Moon Zoo Data page

Built with Harp, Jade and Stylus / Bootstrap (because @rogerhutchings doesn't know how to CSS without it anymore).

## Instructions

### Install

Clone the repo, and run `npm install`.

### Local development

Run a local development server by running `npm run start`. Templates and styles get compiled by Harp on the fly, so just make your changes and refresh to see them.

### Deployment

Deploy with `npm run deploy` to upload to `data.moonzoo.org`. Uses `publisssh`, so you'll need your S3 environment variables and whatnot set.
